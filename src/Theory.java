	 * Access Modifier: Access modifiers in Java define the visibility and accessibility 
	 * of classes, methods, and variables. T
	 * They control where and how code elements can be accessed in a program. 
	 * 
	 * In java there are 4 type of access modifier
	 * a.public---->any class can access
	 * b.default---->classes in same package
	 * c.protected---->classes in same package and sub classes from other package
	 * and it can be possible through inheritance. so we can access the propertices 
	 * from the subclasses's through only the object of subclass 
	 * can 
	 * private--->it can be accesible only in its own class.

	/*Explaining the "System.out.println()"
	 * 1. System is java predefined class.
	 * 2. out is static variable of System class and also instance of PrintStream class
	 * like--- System out=new PrintStream()
	 * but exact is ---PrintStream out = new PrintStream(System.out);
	 * 
	The println() method belongs to the PrintStream class.

	/*In java there are 4 types of variables
	 * 1. Instance variables--variables declared in class level,
	 *    outside any method
	 * 2. Local variable - variables declared in methods 
	 * 3. Static variable - variables belong to class and don't required creating object.and before the variable
	 * we put the static keyword
	 * 4. Method parameter - variables used as method parameter

			/*
			 * a global variable in Java (or other languages) can be static or 
			 *  non-static, depending on how it is defined within a class.

	/*
	 * 3 types of methods
	 * a.Void type
	 * b. Static Method
	 * c.Return type Method
	 * 
	 * The return type of a method determines what type of value the method will return. 
	 * If a method has a void return type, it does not return any value.
